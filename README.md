# Movie Site Project

Weekly Project by Carl Öberg & Fabio Cassisa, Technigo 2023.

### The Problem

In this week´s project we learned about themoviedb.org's API, using react and react router. We faced a quirky challenge with the API sending arrays instead of objects sometimes, but we fixed it up quick. React Router was a game changer for making page navigation smooth. We went minimalistic on detail pages and fresh on the front, balancing simplicity with style. We made a nice 404 page and utilized react icons in project. For the navigate buttons we also found the use for useNavigate.
All in all a fun project to work on!
